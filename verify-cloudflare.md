# Cloudflare Setup Verification

## Important: Get Your Correct Account ID

Your email (abhay.singh@gmail.com) is NOT your Account ID. 

### Steps to Get Account ID:

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Log in with your email: abhay.singh@gmail.com
3. Once logged in, look at the right sidebar on the dashboard
4. You'll see "Account ID" with a value like: `8e7a1b5c2d3f4a6b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d`
5. Copy this 32-character hexadecimal string

### Current Setup Status:

✅ **Cloudflare Pages Project Created:** infinite-canvas-graphic-novels
✅ **Initial Deployment:** https://740326b2.infinite-canvas-graphic-novels.pages.dev
✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Created and pushed
⚠️ **GitHub Secrets:** Need to be added manually

### To Complete Setup:

1. Get your actual Account ID from Cloudflare dashboard (see above)
2. Go to: https://github.com/abhaypsingh/infinite-canvas-graphic-novels/settings/secrets/actions
3. Add two secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: UiWMmAKHTcfU0NnZmEIlM9Df6napk6SAOrLVr0zJ
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: [Your 32-character Account ID from dashboard]

### Testing Your Token:

If you want to verify your API token is working, you can test it:

```bash
# This should return your user details if the token is valid
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer UiWMmAKHTcfU0NnZmEIlM9Df6napk6SAOrLVr0zJ" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Manual Deployment (works now):

```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=infinite-canvas-graphic-novels
```

This manual deployment is working because it uses your browser authentication from when you logged into Cloudflare.
